Iterators become invalidated when inserting, erasing, resizing, and swapping
elements from them. Below is a startegy to take to fix using invalidated iterators,
how to avoid them in the future, and a checklist of classes to be fixed.

Fix Strategy:

- Note: if the collection stores objects by value, all modifications won't effect
the original collection! Thus all collections that will be iterated over must 
contain shared_ptrs. When creating shared_ptrs, don't forget about cyclical
references.

- I think you should ALWAYS make COPIES of collections and iterate on the copies
unless specifically modifying the collection in order to add or remove elements.
Do NOT copy back the collection after iterating but make sure the elements of 
the collection are shared pointers.

- The correct way to erase or replace an element in an iterator is
for(std::list<boost::shared_ptr<T> >::iterator it = myList.begin();
    it != myList.end(); /*don't increment here*/)
{
    if( toErase == *it )
        it = myList.erase(it);
    else
        ++it;
}

- Elements should NOT be push_back on a vector that is currently being 
iterated over. Remember: the copy must be iterated over, the push_back must be
made on the original. Make sure no one has access to the copy (e.g. to pass it to
a method)

- This strategy may be inefficient because I do not know if the shared_ptr
copy ctor is reasonably efficient
