Consider drawing more pictures for this.

Questions:
- Why are they fishing? The old man has wanted to take Rad fishing for years,
but Rad hasn't had the interest. Rad finally agrees.
- Why did Wes really want to take his son fishing? The fishing was just a reason to give,
he really wanted to tell his son something: that the ocean
reminds him of his mother, just as his son, Rad, reminds him of her.
- Rad asks why does the ocean remind him of his mother? Her blue eyes, son.
- How are rad and wes related? Father and son.
- Mothers name? Wendy.
- Why are they fishing to one-hundred pounds? Because once one of them has gotten
there, they've caught plenty.
- How do you expand this into a long story and still make it interesting?
- Rad should continuously disappoint his father, until his father reveals
the actual reason for inviting Rad. (actually, maybe not. But build up tension
somehow)

Outline:
- Describe sunrise. Then say, "An older man is fishing at the pier as usual."
- Wes fishes alone. Describe more of the scene. There's a sadness to him.
- That evening Wes asked Rad to join him fishing, (maybe) saying he bought a hat 
so he won't get sunburned, but Rad declines. (The narrator could tell this part.)
(The hat part is justification for the graphics)
- Wes says that he's asked Rad to fish for years, but he always says no.
- Later Rad shows up at the pier spontaneously.
- Wes: "You came." (Fade into scene)
- It's Rad's first time fishing with his dad.
- Talk about them fishing and what they catch (beautiful)
- Wes: "I've wanted to take you fishing all these years... so to spend time with 
you and tell you the ocean reminds me of your mother.
- Rad, "How... does the ocean remind you of mom?"
- Wes: "Her blue eyes."
- Wes: "... And you remind me of her too."
- Rad: "You're right. The ocean does remind me of Mom."
- Wes: "I'll always remember and miss my sweet love Wendy."
- They fish more, to fill to the brim their coolers that hold the fish.
- A huge wave crashes against the pier, hiding the fishermen in its mist. Then
they emerge, shouting over the loud sounds of the ocean, and Rad exlaims, "What a
great time I'm having!"
- From then on, the two fishermen cast their lines every Saturday morning, 
sometimes hearing whale songs and seeing pods of dolphins, always gazing 
toward the far off horizon.
- The story spans the actual game. That is, the gameplay happens within 
the story. At the end of the story, write something like: A spectator to this
scene captured the day on video. The video has been recored and uploaded to
this game. Just press, "play" on the title menu.

not a character continuing a message?)

- If Wes wins, "We've caught plenty today. I enjoyed fishing with you, son."
