Narrator: A white-haried fisherman sits at the usual spot. He is approached by a
younger fellow.
[Fade-in to scene graphic]
Rad: You've been parked there for ages and haven't caught a thing, old man.
Wes: Patience is a fisherman's strength.
Rad: You must think you're some kind of mighty man then.
Wes: I just fish.
Rad: You just miss.
Wes: *ignore*
Rad: You should see what I catch. It'll make you want to retire.
Wes: You should retire that mouth.
Rad: *speechless*
Wes: What say you, young man, that we make a wager?
Rad: Sure, it'll be a showdown! You don't even have to tell me the conditions!
Wes: Well hear them anyway because you may not like them: The first fisherman to
catch 100 lbs of giant sea bass wins. The loser must clean the fish.
Wes: And if you lose, I'm going to clean out your mouth.
Rad: Wha-wha-what!?
Wes: (Looking Rad in the eyes) You're going to learn some respect.
Rad: (While storming off) Just letting you know ... I'll win!
Rad: (Shouting over shoulder) And I'll make sure this is a wager you regret.
Wes: (To himself) Then let the Sea Bass Showdown begin.
[Fade to black]
Narrator: Will this, indeed, be a wager the elder fisherman regrets? Or will the
arrogant youth clean up the fish ... and his mouth? Let's find out.
