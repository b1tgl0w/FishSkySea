[BLACK]
Narrator: A gray-haried fisherman sits at his usual spot. He is approached by a younger fellow.
[FADE_IN]
Rad: You've sat there for ages and haven't caught a thing, old man.
Wes: Fishermen need patience.
Rad: I catch fish as soon as I cast.
Wes: *Ignore*
Rad: I mean, really, you should see what I catch. It'll make you want to retire.
Wes: You should retire your mouth.
Rad: *Speechless*
Wes: What say you that we make a wager?
Rad: Fine!
Wes: The first fisherman to catch 100 lbs of giant sea bass wins. The loser must clean the fish.
And if you lose, I'm going to clean out your mouth.
Rad: What!
Wes (Looking Rad in the eyes): You're going to learn some respect.
Rad (While storming off): You old man!
Rad (Over his shoulder): You'll regret this!
Wes (Mumbling): Poor kid...
[FADE_OUT]
Narrator: Will this, indeed, be a wager the elder fisherman regrets? Or will the arrogant youth clean up the fish ... and his mouth? Let's find out.
