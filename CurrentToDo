General Task: Importing clip shape and glow into main game.

Specific Steps:
- Improving Experiment efficiency, modularization, etc
- Design clip shape, glow, and renderer in context of game. (Clip shape and
glow should be separate so that clip shape can be reused for other graphic
effects on a sprite)
- Implement
- Test with fish.


Documentation:  Started adding comments to methods. Left off on
CoordinateLayout. Fish incomplete.
