BUG: When the shark face right while glowing, the glow surface is not translucent

Try this:
- In GraphicEffect copy assignment, don't use SDL_DisplayFormatAlpha ( also
copy ctor)
- Freeing and Creating inverseSprite and inverseGlowRectangle every frame (just
to test)

Here's what you've tried in order to fix it:
- Using SDL_Get/MapRGBA in Renderer::scale and Renderer::flip
- Removing the color key from inverseSprite and inverseGlowRectangle
- Not setting an alpha mask when creating a manipulatedImage surface then using
SDL_SetAlpha
- Checking that the alpha using SDL_SetAlpha is normal. It is.
- Calling inverse with Alphad in both places.
- Using MapRGBA with yellow and COLOR_KEY
- Creating yellow2 with SDL_MAPRGB(inverseGlowRectangle->format.
- Deleting GlowRectangle class.
- Used SDL_DisplayFormatAlpha to create a scaled image
- Made an SDL_DisplayFormatAlpha(..) copy of the scaled image after creating
it with SDL_CreateRGBSurface(...)
- Tried not flipping the image. Glow bug still present when shark is moving
right.
- Erasing unused graphic effects

More info:
- This bug can be avoided by setting the width and height of the Shark to the
width and height of the image.
- Since there's only one shark, the image is pruned when flipped.
- Got a couple of error messages with SDL_GetError:
    - Width or Height too large
    - Surfaces must not be locked during blit
