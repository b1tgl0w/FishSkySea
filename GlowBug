BUG: When the shark face right while glowing, the glow surface is not translucent

Here's what you've tried in order to fix it:
- Using SDL_Get/MapRGBA in Renderer::scale and Renderer::flip
- Removing the color key from inverseSprite and inverseGlowRectangle
- Not setting an alpha mask when creating a manipulatedImage surface then using
SDL_SetAlpha
- Checking that the alpha using SDL_SetAlpha is normal. It is.
- Calling inverse with Alphad in both places.
- Using MapRGBA with yellow and COLOR_KEY
- Creating yellow2 with SDL_MAPRGB(inverseGlowRectangle->format.

More info:
- This bug can be avoided by setting the width and height of the Shark to the
width and height of the image.
- Since there's only one shark, the image is pruned when flipped.
