NOTE: Old pocket notebook has already been looked through and added here.

Priority Improvements
- Fish should float up and down (withing their rows) on an elongated sine wave
- Make it fishes' job to predict movement, not the data cruncher
- Redo Story so it's both friendly and interesting.

Unorganized Improvements (May or may not be moved to priority)
- Fish swap depths. Also, size them according to weight (it will cause the 
player to take the whole screen into account) (NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ONE, might
make things too hard)
- Title screen shown before title menu. Menu shown at button press
- Fix fish graphic mouth
- If you put the hook in front of the fish for too long, the fish goes
up to it, doesn't nibble, and runs away because of suspicion. If fisherman
jiggles line, don't run.
- Fisherman has to jiggle line for fish to nibble?
-
- Work on colors
- Don't allow the player to keep the fish on the line too long. Either use
and eel to eat the fish or have the line break. Either way, make sure there
is a visible cue to warn the player
(Save until near end of project) - Dust motes in water
- Sound effects
- Displayer Game Dev Inc. splash screen (or whatever)
- Scenes need a way to flag images for freeing
- Make an easter egg on credits minigame
- Have shark turn around more frequently or do something so it's not so easy
to catch a fish
- Let player choose character
- Put an expiration timer on glowing fish/shark?
- Shark might move in spurts too, at least when not in attack state
- When doing special move, put text above head of character doing the move. e.g.
the name of the move.
- "Particle effects" such as splashing water, aura on glowing fish, snail trail,
bubble, add more
- Menu is in this order: How to Play | Play | 2 Play | ... , the initial
highlighted item, however, is Play.
- Poems (unlockable?)
- 3 Song soundtrack + tite screen + possibly story screen
- Animated yarn, worm, or lure on hook?
- Animated fish mouths
- Interactive splash logo. e.g. when player advances past splash screen
by pressing a key, they get a special animation, e.g. b1tgl0w games starts glowing
briefly then advances. Otherwise does not glow
- Wes uses worm, Rad uses lure
- Make player cast after catching fish

Done
//Done - Press a button to set hook, otherwise fish just nibbles. Note that there
is a "recover" period between being able to set the hook again.
//Done - Lure (worm)
//Done - Pausing: Consider pause on key down unpause on keyup (not during the same press,
obviously)
//Done - Ripples when line is in water
//Done - Slow moving clouds
//Done - Accelerate line and hook for fine movements
//Done - Fish should loop around to other side of screen except when hooked and
first going on screen.
