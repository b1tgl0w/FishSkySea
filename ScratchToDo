FIXED

Bugfix ideas.
- According to gdb, position.y is huge after moveTo is called by adjustCells
- Find out which cell the mb belongs to... done, when added to the cell, it 
is correct
- Find out how to make the cells, and possibly the grid layout, the right size
1. Look in MessageBox and find out why if one line is provided, it works,
but if more than one line, it fails
2. Look in the gridlayout source code at addLayout
3. Being positioned before being scaled?
3. GridCell initialize being called?
4. For some reason, message box grid layout seems to be added to the first
cell of its parent layout, rather than third


1. It's not due to adding sublayouts
2. It seems to be adding the right NUMBER of cells
