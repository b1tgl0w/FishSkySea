After fixing bug
- Credit game scene owns the biography objects
- Try showing one biography before doing others when credit fish is caught
- Ocean or CF is a publisher that notifies subscribers of credit fish catch
- Use boost::signals
- The biographies subscribe to CF through ocean by passing name to connect with
the right CF, perhaps the CF is created at this time too
