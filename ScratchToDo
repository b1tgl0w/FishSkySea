Iterator fix steps:
- Make sure collection contains shared_ptrs, if not, make it so, being aware of cylces
- Make a copy of the collection before the loop
- Change the iterator to iterate on the copy
- Check that method calls don't pass the iterator, if they do, make sure iterator not being modified
- Repeat

Done - Get rid of unneccessary things in credit game scene

Bug Info
- For some reason, the bio graphics and message box don't show
- If picture layout added to top left grid cell, it shows, but nothing else does
- The problem probably isn't in layered layout, it's probably in border or grid 
- Even if the border layout itself is added to renderer, only the picture shows
- Biography doesn't seem to be the culprit
- Why doesn't even the picture get positioned and scaled correctly?

After fixing bug
- Credit game scene owns the biography objects
- Try showing one biography before doing others when credit fish is caught
- Ocean or CF is a publisher that notifies subscribers of credit fish catch
- Use boost::signals
- The biographies subscribe to CF through ocean by passing name to connect with
the right CF, perhaps the CF is created at this time too
